## Dashboard Analysis: Sales Performance Analysis (KPI)

### Key Metrics:
- **Total Sales**: â‚¹823.98M reflects strong sales performance across channels.  
- **Total Orders**: 42,736 orders indicate a high level of customer transactions.  
- **Average Order Value**: â‚¹19,281 suggests a healthy revenue per order.  
- **Total Customers**: 3,603 shows a broad customer base and solid market reach.  

### Insights:
1. **Sales & Orders by Month**:
   - Sales are steady throughout the year, peaking mid-year with slight declines in November and December.  
   - This trend could highlight potential for increased promotions during the latter months.  

2. **Channel Distribution**:
   - **Wholesale** leads with 54% of total sales, indicating its significant contribution to revenue.  
   - **Distributors** account for 31%, while **Export** contributes 15%. The Export channel holds potential for expansion.  

3. **Warehouse: Sales vs. Orders**:
   - **AXW291** generates the highest sales but has a higher total unit cost.  
   - **FLR025** shows minimal activity, indicating possible inefficiencies or areas for growth.  

### Summary:
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance, helping businesses identify trends, optimize sales channels, and streamline warehouse operations. The analysis is dynamic and user-friendly, enabling granular insights through filters for Year, Channel, and Warehouse.
